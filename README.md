# Chatbot UI - Adomant Code Assessment

This repository contains the frontend code for the task assessment given as part of a recruitment process for **Adomant Code**. The objective was to create a chatbot interface where users can interact with an AI chatbot, simulating a basic chat environment like ChatGPT. This system was built using **Next.js**, **Material UI**, and **TailwindCSS**.

## Overview

This project implements a chat interface where a user can interact with a chatbot. The interface follows a specific design provided in Figma, and simulates a basic conversation experience. Here are the core features:

- **Chatbot Interaction**: The chatbot starts each new conversation with “How can I help you?”. After each user message, the chatbot responds with a delayed "This is an AI generated response" (simulating a real response).
- **Typing Animation**: A typing animation is displayed during the 2-second delay before the chatbot replies.
- **Conversation Management**: The chat history, including previous messages, is stored for each conversation and retrieved accordingly.

## Design & Technologies

- **Frontend Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **UI Components**: [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
